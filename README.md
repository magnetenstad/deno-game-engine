# web-game-engine

A zero dependency game 2D engine based on the [standard Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API).

Currently uses [Deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.31.3/getting_started/installation) and [Packup](https://deno.land/x/packup@v0.2.2) for local development and building, but will be made completely agnostic later.

```console
deno task dev
```

```console
deno task build
```
